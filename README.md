# smart

This repository holds files related to sequential analysis using the AIPW estimator in SMARTs. 

The folder 'smartim' can be built as an R package. This library can then be used for simulations. 


Within smartim
value.R contains all functions relating to the AIPW sequential estimator, and
vipw.R contains all functions relating to the IPW sequential estimator.
